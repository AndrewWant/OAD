### MIAP Workshop Program 2019

**Expanding the ZEISS Microscopy Platform: Automation and Image Analysis Solutions based on OAD and APEER**

The goal of this 4-day workshop is to teach and train participants how to employ the ZEISS software
ecosystem for their own projects in image processing, analysis and microscope automation. We will
discuss the latest developments in image analysis and machine learning, including the novel free
image-processing platform APEER, which enables users to exchange image-processing modules and
assemble them into powerful processing workflows. You will learn how to use APEER in the cloud and
how to set up a local APEER solution based on the ACQUIFER HIVE system.

The workshop will include lectures, discussions and extensive hands-on sessions using the
microscope infrastructure of the Life Imaging Center (LIC). Participants are invited to give a talk
about their workshop-related projects, research (requirements) and custom solutions. Participants
are also encouraged to bring their own samples or experimental workflows, discuss them with the
experts and derive custom solutions for their individual microscopy and image analysis challenges.

Please contact us in advance about the prerequisites.

**Basic knowledge in light microscopy and scripting is required.**
